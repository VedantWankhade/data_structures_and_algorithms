# Proof by Induction
* Induction and recursion are similiar.
* Recursion is the mathematical induction in action.
* In both, we have general and boundary conditions, with the general condition breaking the problem into smaller and smaller pieces. The initial or boundary condition terminates the recursion.
* Induction is used to prove incremental or recursive algorithms.

## Real Life Example
Suppose, we line up a large group of people, and hand each of them a piece of paper and a pen. The first person in line (on the far left) will write a number on their paper, and each person will look at their neighbor on the left and copy what their neighbor wrote on the paper. If we glance at what the first person wrote, and his paper says `27`, then intuitively we know that every person has `27` written on their paper (assuming that every person followed the rule faithfully). If you were to explain why you know that is true, you might say something along the lines of "Well, the first person wrote `27` on their paper, and every other person copied the person on their left." That is just your two conditions! We can see how if you took either of them away, we can't say anything about some arbitrary person in the line.

We can make this more complicated by changing the "rule". If instead the rule is that each person adds `1` to what the person on their left had, then intuitively you can see that a person in position `i` in the line will have `whatever the first person had + (i-1)`.

## Example 
**Problem:** Prove the correctness of the following recursive algorithm for incrementing natural numbers, that is, `y -> y + 1`

```
Increment(y)
    if (y = 0) then return 1
    else if (y mod 2) = 1 then return Increment(floor(y/2))
         else return y + 1
```

**Solution:** 

**Basis Case**: Basis case is of `y = 0`, which is correctly handled as it returns `1` and `0 + 1 = 1`.

**Inductive Hypothesis:** Now assume that the algorithm is correct for some number `n - 1`, that is for `y = n - 1` we get correct result. And because this algorithm is recursive, we can safely assume that it works correctly for all the natural values from `1` to `n - 1` i.e for `y <= n - 1`. Now we must proove that it also works for `y = n`.

The case for even number is handled correctly because `y + 1` is explicitly returned.

For odd numbers (i.e the case where `y mod 2 = 1`), the answer depends on what `Increment(floor(y/2))` returns. Here we use our inductive hypothesis.

Now for odd `y`, we can assume `y = 2m + 1` for some natural integer `m`.

Therefore,
```
Increment(y) = 
2 * Increment(Floor(y/2)) = 2 * Increment(Floor((2m + 1)/2))
                          = 2 * Increment(Floor(m + 1/2))
                          = 2 * Increment(m)
                          = 2 * (m + 1)
                          = 2m + 2
Increment(y)              = y + 1
```
**Conclusion:** As for even and odd integer `y`, `Increment(y)` results in `y + 1`, and for basis case of `y = 0` gives correct answer `1`, it is proved that the algorithm works correctly for any natural integer.

# Modelling the Problem using Combinatorial Objects
Real world problems include real objects. For example, suppose we want to write an algorithm for car parking system, this problem include real cars, but we cannot include real cars in our algorithm, we include something that represents a car. In most cases algorithms have to work on a collection of objects, so we have to generalise the collection of objects in one of the following: 
* **Permutations** are arrangements, or orderings, of items. For example, { 1, 4, 3, 2 } and { 4, 3, 2, 1 } are two distinct permutations of the same set of four integers. Permutations are likely the object in question whenever our problem seeks an "arrangement", "tour", "ordering", or "sequence".
* **Subsets** represent selections from a set of items. For example, { 1, 3, 4 } and { 2 } are two distinct subsets of the first four integers. Order does not matter in subsets the way it does with permutations, so the subsets { 1, 3, 4 } and { 4, 3, 1 } would be considered identical. They are likely the object in question whenever your problem seeks a "cluster", "collection", "committee", "group", "packaging", or "selection".
* **Trees** represent hierarchical relationships between items. Trees are likely the object in question whenever your problem seeks a "hierarchy", "dominance relationship", "ancestor/descendant relationship", or "taxonomy".
* **Graphs** represent relationships between arbitrary pairs of objects. For example, a network of roads as a graph, where the vertices are cities and the edges are roads connecting pairs of cities. Graphs are likely the object in question whenever you seek a "network", "circuit", "web", or "relationship".
* **Points** define locations in some geometric space. For example, the locations of McDonaldâ€™s restaurants can be described by points on a map/plane. Points are likely the object in question whenever your problems work on "sites", "positions", "data records", or "locations".
* **Polygons** define regions in some geometric spaces. For example, the borders of a country can be described by a polygon on a map/plane. Polygons and polyhedra are likely the object in question whenever you are working on "shapes", "regions", "configurations", or "boundaries".
* **Strings** represent sequences of characters, or patterns. For example, the names of students in a class can be represented by strings. Strings are likely the object in question whenever you are dealing with "text", "characters", "patterns", or "labels".

**The structures given above are recursive structures, for example, if we remove the first element from a permutation, we get a permutation of remaining elements. Learning to think recursive about these structures is learning to break a big problem into small instances of same kind.**

**Modeling your application in terms of well-defined structures and algorithms is the most important single step towards a solution.**
